# Java Skills Assessment

## Task 1 – Project Setup

I created the project structure, including the `src` folder, `.gitignore`, and a basic `README.md`.

I also wrote a `compile.bat` script to compile Java files using the `javac` command.

This step helped me understand the importance of setting up a clean and organized development environment.

## Task 2 – Basic Java Programming

### Task 2.1 – UserInfo.java

I implemented a class that stores user details using proper access modifiers.

The class includes a constructor, getter and setter methods, and a display method.

This task reinforced my understanding of object-oriented principles and encapsulation.

### Task 2.2 – PayrollCalculator.java

I created a payroll system that calculates weekly pay based on employee types and conditions.

The solution handles edge cases such as invalid input and overtime rules.

I also added logic to calculate tax deductions using nested conditions.

Working with arrays and tracking statistics (highest, lowest, average) helped me apply array manipulation techniques in a practical context.

## Task 3 – Strings and Arrays

### GradeManager.java

In this task, I practiced reversing strings, assigning letter grades based on numeric scores, and identifying failing students using loops and conditions.

### TextProcessor.java

I wrote methods to count words in a sentence and replace specific words with new ones.

This task improved my ability to work with Java string methods like `split()` and `replace()`.

## Task 4 – Object-Oriented Programming

### Library Book System

I created a base class `Book` and an extended class `Textbook`.

This task involved using protected access, constructors, inheritance, and method overriding.

It helped me practice OOP principles in a structured example.

### VisitorCounter.java

This task taught me the difference between static and non-static variables and methods.

I implemented a shared counter for all visitors and individual counters for session visits.

## Task 5 – Problem Solving with Loops and Conditions

### ShoppingCart.java

I developed a shopping cart system that applies discounts based on customer type and calculates total prices, the most expensive item, and how many items exceed a price threshold.

### PatternMaker.java

I implemented two methods: one to print a number triangle and another to print a multiplication table.

This helped reinforce my understanding of nested loops.

## Testing Strategy

I compiled and tested each file using the `compile.bat` script in the root directory. The output `.class` files were generated in the `out` directory. This ensured all classes were syntactically correct and working as expected.
